<h3>Resources</h3>
Each lesson will outline a resource, usually an article, book chapter, or video for you to read or watch. All resources required to complete this course are open, meaning that there are no resources for you to purchase. It also means that you are free to reuse, remix, repurpose or mashup the resources according to how they are licensed.
<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
As this is a self-paced, but hopefully not independent study, course, the learning activities in which you will engage will be recorded on your blog. We encourage you to share your blog posts with your <a title="Personal Learning Network" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_learning_network" >personal learning network</a>. If you don't currently have a network of colleagues with whom you can engage in conversation about teaching online, we hope that this course will help you to identify other online educators and begin to share your thoughts, challenges, victories and failures.
<h3>Reflection</h3>
We believe that there is tremendous power in becoming a 'reflective practitioner'. Among all the learning experiences in which you can engage, reflecting on the efficacy of what you do and inviting others to add their reflections on your work, is among <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-shareski/how-to-make-better-teache_b_783392.html" >the most powerful</a>.
<blockquote>In fact, I've yet to hear anyone who has stuck with blogging suggest it's been anything less than essential to their growth and improvement. ~Dean Shareski</blockquote>
TRU is blessed with an abundance of riches when it comes to learning to be a reflective educator. Among the thought leaders on the TRU campus is <a href="http://tracypennylight.com/" >Tracy Penny Light</a>, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.tru.ca/ctl.html" >Centre for Student Engagement and Learning Innovation</a>. Tracy recently sat down with Brian Lamb and Alan Levine (a visiting scholar from Arizona) to talk about the idea of <a href="http://youshow.trubox.ca/2015/01/14/conversation-with-tracy-penny-light" >reflection and how to de-mystify the process. </a>
<h3>Expectations</h3>
This is a course primarily for professional educators in a variety of contexts.

We expect that you will be collegial in your interactions, generous in sharing your expertise, honest in claiming or giving credit, and diligent in your responses.
<h3>Recognition</h3>
Upon completion of this course, you will have earned a printed certificate of completion.
