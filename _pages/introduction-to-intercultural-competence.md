It is becoming increasingly important for people to be able to navigate the complexities of interacting with people from cultures that are different from their own. This can be both enriching and frustrating for faculty and students alike.

The following video, from a Japanese TV show, is a good illustration of how perceptions can sometimes be misaligned to reality in intercultural situations. In the video, the results are intended to be humourous, but in an academic setting, the results can be very expensive, both financially and personally.

Culturally conditioned perceptions can often be blind spots in our interactions with people from different cultures. When we don't know how another person will perceive something we say, how we say it, or the consequences of misunderstanding, conflict will inevitably arise. As we will see in future lessons, navigating conflict well is a key skill for ensuring that students are able to construct meaning through academic discourse.
