Welcome to the <em>Open and Connected Learning</em> series of courses hosted by Trinity Western University Online and based on a series of courses offered by the Program Delivery department at Thompson Rivers University Open Learning.

This series is based on the <a title="Community of Inquiry" href="http://coi.athabascau.ca" target="_blank">Community of Inquiry (CoI)</a> model of teaching and learning with each course focused on one of the defined 'presences' in the CoI.

As you can see, these courses are both free and openly licensed. That means that you can not only participate at no cost, but you are also permitted (encouraged!) to exercise your <a href="http://www.opencontent.org/definition/" target="_blank">5R rights</a> with respect to open content.
