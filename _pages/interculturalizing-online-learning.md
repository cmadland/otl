The <a href="http://www.tru.ca/learning.html" target="_blank">Centre for Student Engagement and Learning Innovation</a> at TRU has taken seriously the institutional mandate to:
<blockquote>engage students in the quest for world citizenship through …cultural learning opportunities, in a respectful and inclusive environment that provides a better understanding and appreciation of our global community.[note]http://www.tru.ca/__shared/assets/2014-2019_StrategicPriorities_PDF31428.pdf[/note]</blockquote>
The Centre offers a workshop titled <em>Intercultural Eyesing the Curriculum</em> to prepare faculty to increase their level of intercultural competence in their teaching practice.

This set of resources and activities is an online tidbit of the full workshop. You are free to engage with these resources as you see fit, and we invite you to respond to the activities on your own blog. Even better, we hope that you'll consider participating in the full workshop, typically held each spring on campus.

We hope that these activities will give you some insight into the unique challenges faced by international students, as well as some ideas for how you can work towards becoming more interculturally competent in your interactions with students from various backgrounds.

If you'd like assistance setting up a blog, please see the WordPress resources in the widget at the bottom of this page.
