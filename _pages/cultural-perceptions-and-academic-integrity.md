I remember having a conversation with a person who grew up in the USA about how a particular peanut butter-based dessert would be delicious with the candy <em>Smarties. </em>He was confused and thought I was a little bit off my rocker, so I patiently explained that I thought that peanut butter and the chocolate in S<em>marties</em> would go well together, just like in <em>M&amp;Ms </em>or <em>Reese Peanut Butter Cups. </em>He was still confused and couldn't understand why <em>Smarties</em> would go well with peanut butter. While the conversation was light-hearted, we were clearly not speaking about the same thing, so we turned to the internet to solve the discrepancy in our individual understandings. We started at <a href="http://www.smarties.com" target="_blank">smarties.com</a>, and it quickly became clear why he was wrong about <em>Smarties. </em> He was thinking about <a href="http://www.rocketscandy.ca/" target="_blank"><em>Rockets, </em></a>while I was thinking about<em> <a href="https://www.nestlegoodfoodgoodlife.ca/smarties/" target="_blank">Smarties.</a></em>

Had this conversation been about something important with high stakes, including the possibility of the loss of a significant amount of money, or personal embarrassment, the resulting frustration could have led to a very tense situation. Fortunately, we were both in a frame of mind to be able to realize the we were talking about candy, and also we were attuned to the possibility of cultural differences as we were both living in Japan at the time.

This is similar to the differences in how different cultures understand the colour of zebras. Charles Berlitz[note]Berlitz, C. (1982) <em>Native Tongues</em>. Putnam, New York[/note] reports that Africans tend to view zebras as being black animals with white stripes, whereas North Americans see the zebra as being a white animal with black stripes.

One important area where there is often a misalignment of culturally conditioned perceptions between different cultures is the idea of academic integrity. In western academic settings, there are very specific rules and expectations regarding the proper citation of ideas that are not your own. Although there is significant disparity in the west between <em>how</em> others' ideas should be cited, there is universal acceptance <em>that</em> others' ideas ought to be cited. Furthermore, the consequences of what is considered plagiarism in the west are sometimes severe, so faculty feel the need to be very clear and specific about what plagiarism is and how bad it will be for students who contravene the rules.

The following video (19 mins) was prepared by BCCampus as part of their <a href="http://scope.bccampus.ca/file.php/8/5061_CDL/cdl/index.html" target="_blank">C<em>ulturally Diverse Learners</em></a> series.

As you can see in the video, different cultures have different expectations regarding citing the work of others. In some cultures, students are expected to memorize and repeat what is in the textbook in order to show honour to their instructor. For those students, paraphrasing and citing other's ideas is literally a foreign concept, and it takes time and practice to adjust.

One of the changes that the faculty member in the video made was to move from characterizing citation problems as grounds for automatic failure, to opportunities to learn within the safe confines of the classroom, which is precisely what students should be doing in the classroom. It is important to note that by removing automatic penalties, he does not diminish the importance of proper citations. Instead, he provides opportunity for understanding and support for students who should be <em>expected</em> to make mistakes.

By doing this, he acknowledges that his students are novices and provides an avenue for students to project a sense of their own identity and personal background into the learning environment. This is the fundamental premise of 'social presence', which we will examine in the next course.
