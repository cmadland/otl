	<li>If you would like, add a widget to your sidebar or footer to display posts in the 'Showcase' category.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>What are 2-3 of the most important ideas that you have studied during this course?</li>
	<li>What are 2-3 questions that you have as a result of this course? Identify ways that you can begin to answer those questions.</li>
	<li>Identify 2-3 specific goals that you would like to achieve in light of what you have learned about cognitive presence, approaches to learning, and feedback;
<ul>
