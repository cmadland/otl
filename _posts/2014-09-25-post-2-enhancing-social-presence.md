Look back at your entry for <a title="POST 1 â€“ Getting Started" href="http://courses.olblogs.tru.ca/facdev/topic/post-1-getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post 1</a> in this course.

Create a new post and
<ul>
	<li>describe the ways in which your introductory post should have enhanced social presence in a course that you teach,</li>
	<li>identify at least one improvement that you might make in light of what you know about social presence since completing your first post, and</li>
	<li>describe how your thinking about social presence has changed since your first post.</li>
</ul>
Make sure you add your post to the categories 'otl201' and 'post 2'.

When you have posted, please read through a few other participants' posts and add your voice to their blogs.

When you are done, mark this lesson as complete and continue to <a title="Lesson 2" href="http://courses.olblogs.tru.ca/facdev/lessons/lesson-2-2/">Lesson 2</a>.
