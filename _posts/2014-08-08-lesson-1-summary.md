Recall that the intended outcome for lesson 1 is that you would explore the characteristics of ‘cognitive presence’ in an effective online learning environment. You should have demonstrated your attainment of this outcome in each of your two blog posts, but more importantly, in Post #2, where you identified your new knowledge and any gaps or questions that you may want to address.

When you are satisfied that you have met the intended outcome, mark Lesson 1 as 'Complete' and move on to Lesson 2.
