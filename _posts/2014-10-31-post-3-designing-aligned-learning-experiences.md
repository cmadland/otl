Your task for post #3 is to create 2-3 intended learning outcomes for an area of knowledge or skill within your area of expertise or training.

Then create a learning activity (or two) aligned to one or more of those intended learning outcomes.

Please make sure that your outcomes and activities address the design principles. Follow the suggested procedures for designing aligned learning experiences as outlined in this lesson.

When you are finished, please categorize your post under 'otl301' and tag it as 'Post 3'.
