In the previous two courses, <a title="think" href="http://courses.olblogs.tru.ca/facdev/courses/think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>think</em></a> and <a title="engage" href="http://courses.olblogs.tru.ca/facdev/courses/engage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>engage</em></a>, we explored the characteristics of <em>cognitive presence</em> and <em>social presence</em> in online communities of inquiry.

This final course of the series will take you through an examination and application of <em>teaching presence</em> in a community of inquiry.
<h4>Post 1</h4>
To begin, think about an example of an effective practice you have experienced with regard to online learning, either as a learner or a facilitator. You may want to jot down notes, use a journal, or draw a concept map to describe the story of your experience with this example of good practice. Feel free also to use any of the tools that we have used in previous courses.

<div>

Now, relate this example to other experiences you have had. You can use some of the following sentence starters to help you:

</div>
<ul>
	<li>This reminds me of . . . .</li>
	<li>I remember when . . .</li>
	<li>This situation is just like . . .</li>
	<li>It makes me feel that . . .</li>
	<li>This compares to . . .</li>
	<li>This is different from . . .</li>
</ul>
Now consider your example again and answer the following questions:
<ul>
	<li>Why was this an effective practice for you?</li>
	<li>What are some of the key ingredients that underlie the experience you had?</li>
	<li>If you could do it over again, what would you change to improve your experience?</li>
</ul>
Take a few minutes to record some of your thoughts on effective practices in a new blog post and please include a brief self-introduction.
