Throughout this course you will be referred to <a href="http://aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229"  rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Teaching in a blended learning environment</em> </a>by Vaughan, Cleveland-Innes and Garrison. The book is available to order or as a free download from AUPress. Â  While the book is clearly aimed at blended learning environments where significant learning outcomes are met in both face-to-face and online contexts, the focus on <em>teaching presence</em> is also applicable in solely online environments.
