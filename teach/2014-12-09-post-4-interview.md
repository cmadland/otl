Chapter 3 of<em> Teaching in Blended Learning Environments</em>[note]Vaughan, N., Cleveland-Innes, M., &amp; Garrison, D. (2013). <em>Teaching in blended learning environments: Creating and sustaining communities of inquiry</em>. Athabasca: AU Press. Retrieved from <a href="http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229"  rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229</a>[/note] highlights several strategies for facilitating deep, meaningful learning experiences in <em>blended</em> environments. However, the focus of this particular course is self-paced, continuous entry courses, where students may not have the benefit of other students working through the materials at the same time or pace that they are. Consequently, some of the suggested strategies may be very difficult to implement.

Your task for post #4 is to interview a colleague who has taught in a continuous entry course. Interview them about their strategies for facilitating both social and cognitive presence in this learning environment. Â Part of this conversation may include providing background information on the Community of Inquiry model and the characteristics of teaching presence.

Suggested topics of conversation might be:
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left">how to promote community and connection in a continuous entry course;</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">strategies for facilitating the process of critical inquiry, especially those leading to integration and resolution;</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">how the strategies in Chapter 3 might be modified for a continuous entry course;</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">digital tools to support the process of critical inquiry in a continuous entry course;</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">questions that you have struggled with;</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">questions that your interviewee has struggled with.</li>
</ul>
Post #4 should be a summary of your interview, including:
<ul>
	<li>the topics of discussion and/or questions asked;</li>
	<li>answers, solutions, suggestions or other advice given;</li>
	<li>2-3 key lessons learned through the conversation;</li>
	<li>how you might use what you have learned in your courses;</li>
	<li>any other thoughts or questions that you think are relevant.</li>
</ul>
When you are finished, categorize your post under 'otl301' and tag it as 'Post 4'.
