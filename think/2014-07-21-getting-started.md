Before you continue, here is a short checklist of activities for you to complete before you get started with the primary content of the courses:
<ul>
 	<li>register for a blog,</li>
 	<li>work through some basic <a href="http://create.twu.ca/connect/resources-and-learning-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress resources</a>, in particular, please make sure you spend some time getting familiar with the logistics of the course and how to set up your blog. These resources are also linked in the menu at the bottom of each topic and lesson, under the heading 'WordPress Resources'.
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://create.twu.ca/connect/participate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Participate</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://create.twu.ca/connect/why-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why WordPress?</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://elearning.trubox.ca/understanding-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding WordPress</a></li>
 	<li>Ensure that you have set up at least three categories on your blog, OCL101, OCL201, and OCL301.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><a href="http://create.twu.ca/connect/understanding-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choose a theme</a> for your blog (or not, the default is fine),</li>
 	<li>install and activate any plugins that you would like to use.</li>
</ul>
If you are unfamiliar with WordPress, please do not hesitate to reach out! If you are spending more than 10 minutes or so stuck on a problem in WordPress, please contact me at colin.madland@twu.ca.

In lesson 1 there are three primary activities. To begin you need to introduce yourself to others in this Community of Inquiry (CoI). Then you will be guided to explore the idea of <em>cognitive presence</em>, a key component of the model. Lastly you will share your thoughts on how the CoI model, and cognitive presence in particular, are important for promoting student attainment of learning outcomes in online learning.
<h3>Blog Post 1</h3>
Before you get started on this activity, please take a few minutes to review <a href="http://create.twu.ca/connect/guidelines-for-blog-posts/">these guidelines</a> for blog posts.

Next, please create a new post on your own blog, and introduce yourself. Keep in mind that your posts will be showing up on the <a href="http://create.twu.ca/connect/blog/">blog on this site</a>, so please make sure that each post has a unique and descriptive title.

Your introduction could be an image created at wordle.net using text gathered from the following online searches and pasted into <a href="http://www.wordle.net/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordle</a> (you may need to install or update <a href="http://java.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a> to get the tool to work):
<ol>
 	<li>a description of your favourite vacation spot.</li>
 	<li>a synopsis of the last novel that you read.</li>
 	<li>your answers to the following questions in 2-3 sentences:
<ul>
 	<li>What is the most important characteristic of high quality online learning environments and why it is important?</li>
 	<li>What is one thing that you have learned about teaching online (or face-to-face if you haven't taught online) in the last year and how has it impacted your practice?</li>
 	<li>What questions do you have about online teaching and learning?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Once you have pasted each of these snippets of text, click 'Go', then use the tools at the top of the Wordle to edit the outcome. To post it to your blog, you can either take a screenshot or save it to the public gallery and include a link on your blog.

Below your Wordle, please provide a brief explanation and reflection on the outcome.

If Wordle doesn't cooperate, feel free to simply answer the 3 questions in item #3 above, and maybe include an image or two in your post.
<h4>WordPress Tip!</h4>
<p style="padding: 2px 6px 4px 6px; color: #ffffff; background-color: #555555;">Make sure that you add your post to your 'ocl101' category and 'Post 1' tag so that others can easily find your post.</p>
When you have completed this topic, click 'Mark Complete'.
