Your task for Lesson 3 is to plan and create a short video that you can use in multiple courses to either introduce yourself or to provide a relevant tutorial or commentary. You may also want to create a video to summarize your learning regarding the CoI.

Please make sure that your video aligns with the objectives of social presence as outlined in <a title="Social Presence" href="http://elearning.trubox.ca/topic/social-presence/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesson 2 </a>and the <a title="Creating Effective Media" href="http://elearning.trubox.ca/topic/creating-effective-media/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">principles of effective educational media</a> from earlier in this lesson.

You may use whatever technology you have available, there are suggestions in <a title="POST 1 – Getting Started" href="http://elearning.trubox.ca/topic/post-1-getting-started/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesson 1</a>.

Please keep your video to under 5 minutes and post it to your blog when you are finished.

Don't forget to categorize it as 'otl201' and  add the tag 'post 4'.

When you are finished, mark Lesson 3 as complete and proceed to <a title="Lesson 4" href="http://elearning.trubox.ca/lessons/lesson-4-2/">Lesson 4</a>.
