Previously, we considered the impact of cognitive presence on online distance learning environments. Our goal in this course is  to build on that idea with the concept of social presence, the second element of the <a href="http://coi.athabascau.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community of Inquiry</a> framework.

Having completed the first course, you will have access to a blog which you should continue to use for this course. If you do not yet have a blog, please take some time to <a title="Participate" href="http://courses.olblogs.tru.ca/facdev/participate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set one up</a> and send your details to elearningfacilitator@tru.ca.

To begin, please introduce yourself in a new post which includes a brief bio and the following elements:
<ul>
	<li>a recording of your voice,</li>
	<li>an image of you, and,</li>
	<li>an image of something that tells other people about something important to you.</li>
</ul>
You are free to decide how to incorporate those elements into your post. You may want to record a short video, upload a slideshow with voice narration, you may want to have the audio and visuals entirely separate, or you might decide to draw something. Be creative!

Below are several tools which may be useful in composing and sharing this post.
<h5>Composing</h5>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://soundcloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a> allows users to record and share audio files on the web.</li>
	<li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audacity</a> is a free download for Mac, Linux, or Windows and allows users to record and edit audio files which can then be uploaded to a blog or service such as SoundCloud.</li>
	<li>GarageBand is an audio recording and editing tool for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/garageband/id682658836?mt=12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac OSX</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/garageband/id408709785?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>.</li>
	<li>iMovie is a video recording tool for <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/mac/imovie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac OSX</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/imovie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jing</a> is a handy little program you can use to record a screencast of up to 5 minutes and then share through screencast.com.</li>
	<li><a href="https://popcorn.webmaker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popcorn Maker</a> allows you to create a mashup of online videos or sounds from YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud or other tools.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sharing</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Once you have recorded your message, please upload it to the web using one of the free sharing tools, such as:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://soundcloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundCloud</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://vimeo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vimeo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>WordPress makes it very easy to share files from the three sharing tools above. All you have to do is copy the URL of your media and paste the URL into your post. WordPress will automatically embed your media with a media player.</li>
	<li>Alternatively, and if you are feeling a little more adventurous, the <a href="http://splot.ca/sounder/share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRU Sound Collector</a>  allows users to upload and share audio files from their own computer or via links to SoundCloud.</li>
	<li>Similarly, the <a href="http://splot.ca/collector/desk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRU Image Collector</a> allows users to upload images and share them easily. The secret code to access the Image collector is 'tru collector' (with the space).
<ul>
	<li>Please upload or link your sound and image to the TRU Sound and Image Collectors and then provide links in your post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
There is an extensive set of resources on recording and sharing audio at the <a href="http://youshow.trubox.ca/about/props/audio-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouShow site</a>, a course offered by TRU between January and March 2015.
